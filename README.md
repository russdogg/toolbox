Russdesigns Toolbox Â» Version 0.1
=================================

This is my first attempt at putting together a javascript toolkit all in one place.


Some sample code:

        ['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }

For example, you can do a shortcut:

        ['a', 'b'].map(&:uppercase)

Some people seem to like definition lists

<dl>
  <dt>Lower cost</dt>
  <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
  <dt>Easier to use</dt>
  <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
</dl>


Table for two
-------------

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>Tom Preston-Werner</td><td>Awesome</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td><td>Albert Einstein</td><td>Nearly as awesome</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Crazy linking action

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from
[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].
